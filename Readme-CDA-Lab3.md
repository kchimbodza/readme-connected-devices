**Constrained Device Application (Connected Devices)**

Lab Module 03

Description

**What the Implementation does**

My Lab Module 3 implementation creates a comprehensive IoT simulation system with automatic climate control capabilities. The CDA now generates realistic time-series sensor data for temperature, humidity, and pressure while automatically controlling HVAC systems based on configurable temperature thresholds (floor: 19째C, ceiling: 20째C). The system uses mathematical models through SensorDataGenerator to create authentic 24-hour data sets with 1440 entries each, simulating real-world sensor behavior with configurable noise levels. When temperature readings exceed boundaries, the DeviceDataManager automatically triggers HVAC actuator commands, creating a complete smart building simulation that demonstrates sensing, analysis, and actuation in a cohesive IoT system.

**How it works**

The system is built around DeviceDataManager, which controls three subsystems using callback functions. SensorAdapterManager uses APScheduler to collect data every 5 seconds from three simulated sensors: temperature, humidity, and pressure. These sensors use either time-series data or random values. If the temperature goes above 20째C or below 19째C, DeviceDataManager sends HVAC commands to ActuatorAdapterManager. This manager checks the location ID and forwards commands to the correct simulator (HVAC or humidifier), which logs realistic on/off actions. Duplicate commands are filtered to avoid unnecessary actuator changes. SystemPerformanceManager tracks CPU and memory every 60 seconds. The whole system runs through ConstrainedDeviceApp, ensuring smooth startup, shutdown, and error handling.

**UML Design Diagram(s)**

UML diagram showing DeviceDataManager as central orchestrator implementing IDataMessageListener, coordinating SensorAdapterManager (with TemperatureSensorSimTask, HumiditySensorSimTask, PressureSensorSimTask using SensorDataGenerator), ActuatorAdapterManager (with HvacActuatorSimTask, HumidifierActuatorSimTask), and SystemPerformanceManager. All components use APScheduler for background task execution with callback-driven data flow and automatic threshold-based climate control logic.
